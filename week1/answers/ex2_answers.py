# ── Task B ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# The scaffold ships with a working generate_event_flyer that has two paths:
#
#   - Live mode: if FLYER_IMAGE_MODEL is set in .env, the tool calls that
#     model and returns a real image URL.
#   - Placeholder mode: otherwise (the default) the tool returns a
#     deterministic placehold.co URL with mode="placeholder".
#
# Both paths return success=True. Both count as "implemented" for grading.
# This is not the original Task B — the original asked you to write a direct
# FLUX image call, but Nebius removed FLUX on 2026-04-13. See CHANGELOG.md
# §Changed for why we pivoted the task.

# Did your run of the flyer tool produce a success=True result?
# (This will be True for both live and placeholder mode — both are valid.)
TASK_B_IMPLEMENTED = True   # True or False

# Which path did your run take? "live" or "placeholder"
# Look for the "mode" field in the TOOL_RESULT output of Task B.
# If you didn't set FLYER_IMAGE_MODEL in .env, you will get "placeholder".
TASK_B_MODE = "placeholder"

# The image URL returned by the tool. Copy exactly from your terminal output.
# In placeholder mode this will be a placehold.co URL.
# In live mode it will be a provider CDN URL.

# Why did the agent's behaviour NOT change when Nebius removed FLUX?
# One sentence. This is the point of the lesson.
TASK_B_WHY_AGENT_SURVIVED = """
The agent's behaviour did not change when Nebius removed FLUX because the tool implemented a graceful fallback pattern. The tool returns a deterministic placeholder URL with mode="placeholder" and the full prompt recorded for audit. Both paths are valid and the agent's behaviour is preserved.

SCENARIO_2_FINAL_ANSWER = """
The agent admitted that no venue could fit 300 guests with vegan options and suggested to check other venues.

# Scenario 3: out of scope (train times)

SCENARIO_3_RESPONSE = "<think>\nOkay, the user is asking about the last train time from Edinburgh Waverley to London tonight. Let me check the tools provided.\n\nLooking at the available functions: check_pub_availability, get_edinburgh_weather, calculate_catering_cost, generate_event_flyer. None of these are related to train schedules. The functions are for checking pub availability, weather, catering costs, and generating flyers. \n\nSince there's no tool for train times, I can't use any of the provided functions to answer this. I need to inform the user that I don't have access to that information and suggest they check a train service website or app.\n</think>\n\nI don't have access to real-time train schedules or transportation data. For the most accurate information about the last train from Edinburgh Waverley to London, I recommend checking:\n1. The National Rail website (https://www.nationalrail.co.uk)\n2. Train service apps like Citymapper or Trainline\n3. The specific train operator's website (e.g., LNER)\n\nWould you like help with anything related to Edinburgh pubs, weather, or event planning instead?"

# Would this behaviour be acceptable in a real booking assistant? Min 30 words.
SCENARIO_3_ACCEPTABLE = """
The agent correctly handled the out of scope request by informing the user that it doesn't have access to train schedules and suggested alternative sources. This is a reasonable response for a booking assistant that can't provide that information.

# Compare the LangGraph graph to exercise3_rasa/data/flows.yml. Min 30 words.
TASK_D_COMPARISON = """
The LangGraph Mermaid graph shows a very small ReAct loop: start -> agent -> tools-> agent, with the model deciding at runtime whether to stop or call another tool. By contrast, Rasa's `flows.yml` lists each task and its steps explicitly, so the LLM mainly chooses which predefined flow to start and Rasa handles the rest more deterministically. LangGraph is more flexible, while Rasa is more structured, auditable, and easier to predict.

# ── Reflection ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# The most unexpected thing the agent did. Min 40 words.
# Must reference a specific behaviour from your run.

MOST_SURPRISING = """
The most surprising part was that the agent handled failure modes more sensibly
than I expected. In Scenario 2, it checked all known venues for the impossible
300-person requirement and then clearly admitted that none fit, instead of
inventing a pub. In Scenario 3, it also recognized that train times were outside
its toolset and refused to guess, which made the behaviour feel much more robust
than a typical chatbot response.
